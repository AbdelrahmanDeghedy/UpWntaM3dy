### A Centralized Q/A Website for Students.

1. Get sick of following what's app groups all day long? and reading though all old messages in order to find a specific answer?
2. Tired of Facebook endless distractions?
3. Love compiting, and getting recognitions for your answers?

**If the answer is YES, then this place is for you!**

This project aims to be similar to "stackoverflow" idea, but for college. All answers will be stored, and can be used as a reference for students in any later year.

You can tune the many filtering options to find the specific answer you need.
